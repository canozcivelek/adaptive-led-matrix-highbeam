# Adaptive LED Matrix High Beams

### Project Description & Objective

This project was created to demonstrate a more sophisticated approach to modern/standard headlight technology used in present cars on road.
In addition to having the mandatory low and high beams, this project aims to demonstrate how LED technology can be used to create a more
flexible and safe driving experience under low light/dark conditions. The main objective of this technology is to illuminate as much of the 
road as possible while not dazzling other drivers for both oncoming and preceding traffic.
This is made possible in this projdect with 2 sub-systems in communication. First is the module to control the hardware (LED matrix), second is 
a camera to detect vehicles and their locations to determine where to lighten/darken.
